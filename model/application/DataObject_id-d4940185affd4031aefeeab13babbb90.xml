    documentation="A protocol binding describes how events are sent and received over a given protocol.&#xD;&#xA;Protocol bindings MAY choose to use an Event Format to map an event directly to the transport envelope body, or MAY provide additional formatting and structure to the envelope. For example, a wrapper around a structured-mode message might be used, or several messages could be batched together into a transport envelope body."/>
